# BioBlogs & MalariaCellClassifier
“BioBlogs and MalariaCellClassifier” is a multifaceted project that combines the 
functionality of a blogging platform with a sophisticated machine learning model for 
malaria cell classification. The project aims to provide a comprehensive solution that 
addresses both the need for knowledge sharing in the healthcare domain and the 
advancement of malaria diagnostics through machine learning
"BioBlogs and MalariaCellClassifier" utilizes Django, a Python web framework, to 
create an intuitive web interface enabling users to write blogs, register accounts, and access 
user-contributed content. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for malaria 
cell classification.
